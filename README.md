Provides Navigation feature between JBehave .story files and Java Step files, just using Ctrl+Click over a step, or the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+G, or the contextual menu in .story files.

Includes Code Completion for steps in .story files, and also a JBehave .story Syntax Checker.

Performance highly improved by adding an in memory Steps Dictionary containing all steps defined in current open projects. New option to Reload Steps Dictionary added to the contextual menu in .story files.
